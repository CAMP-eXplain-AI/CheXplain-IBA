#### In a nutshell
We propose several explanation methodologies building on Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA):

* Our main contribution is the Inverse IBA saliency (attribution) method which identifies *any* region that has predictive information for the model.
* We also propose Regression IBA for explaining regression models. Using Regression IBA we observe that a model trained on cumulative COVID-19 severity score labels implicitly learns the severity of different X-ray regions.
* Finally, we propose Multi-layer IBA to generate higher resolution and detailed attribution/saliency maps.
